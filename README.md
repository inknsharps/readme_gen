# Markdown Readme Generator

## Description

This is a readme generator that generates a Markdown file through the node.js environment.

## Installation

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system first. After installing, either `git clone`, or download this repository. Then, navigate to the folder on your local files in the command line, and run:

``` 
    npm install 
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the app to work.

## Usage

Once you've installed all dependencies, navigate to the folder in the command line, and run:

```
    node index.js
```
You will be prompted for inputs to include in the readme file. Once all prompts have been answered, a new readme file containing your parameters will be generated in the root folder of the application.
