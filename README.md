# Markdown Readme Generator

## Description

This is a readme generator that generates a Markdown file through the node.js environment and command line. The application can receive inputs for a readme containing a table of contents, description, installation, usage, contribution, tests, license and a contact section. It will also generate a badge for your license.

## Installation

Have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system first. Then after installing node.js, either `git clone`, or download this repository. Then, navigate to the folder on your local files in the command line, and run:

``` 
    npm install 
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the app to work.

## Usage

Once you've installed all dependencies, navigate to the folder in the command line, and run:

```
    node index.js
```
You will be prompted for inputs to include in the readme file. Once all prompts have been answered, a new readme file containing your parameters will be generated in the root folder of the application. Please note that the file name that is generated will be `ProjectName-readme.md`, so if you generate another project containing the same name, it will be overwritten.
